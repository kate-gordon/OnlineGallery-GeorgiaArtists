## Decription

For this group project, we chose to create an online art gallery for a local non-proft, Georgia Artists with DisAbilities. This organization currently only sells artwork created by its members in person in public spaces around the state of Georgia, including local libraries.

Our goal is to give the organization a platform to reach a larger audience, sell more artwork, and in turn, support more local artists. We are also focusing on creating a web experience in the gallery that is both inclusive and accessible.

We also created an Administrator control panel for a Board Member to login and gain access to manage the artwork database.
